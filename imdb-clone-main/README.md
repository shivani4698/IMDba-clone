# IMDb Clone

This project is a web application that utilizes the power of vanilla JavaScript to provide a seamless user experience. The main feature of the app is its ability to search for movie and provide a trailer of that movie using the tmdb API and youtube API. APIs return a variety of data related to the searched movie, such as movie title, year, and other important information. The app then displays this information in an easy-to-read format, allowing users to quickly find the movie details they are looking for to watch.

In addition to the search feature, the app also includes the ability for users to view details of the selected movie. This includes a more in-depth look at the movie's details with a trailer. Users can also mark their favorite movie for easy access in the future.

Overall, this project demonstrates your skills in working with APIs, JavaScript, and web development in general. The use of vanilla JavaScript allows for a lightweight and fast-performing application, without the need for any additional JavaScript frameworks.
